## Thesis Draft

The thesis draft should be **1/2 - 1 page**. This draft is non-committal. You are welcome and encouraged to change your thesis as you develop your paper. It's often easier to make some progress when you have a tentative direction to work with, even when you know that direction is not quite perfect.
